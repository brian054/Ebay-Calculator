# Ebay-Calculator
I made this in 2018 to calculate net profits on items I resell on Ebay. It takes into account paypal fees, ebay fees, and shipping fees. I created this in high school as I was manually calculating my net profit for each item I sold. I was just learning how to write code but at a certain point I realized writing a program for this would be much easier for myself.
